# *Link's Awakening* (Switch) reverse engineering notes

WORK IN PROGRESS

## What's in this repository?

* Information and sometimes documentation about game internals. These files have the \*.md extension
in this repository.

* Some plain text files that were extracted from the executable or generated from the ROM,
containing information about game internals as well.

* Tools for understanding some game files in [tools](tools/).

* Tools and IDA scipts for reverse engineering the game and dumping structures/values
from the executable in [tools/ida](tools/ida).

* Note: I will publish a Grezzo datasheet (gsheet) library and tool later.
